title: Beginning Treehouse
---

I signed up recently for the free Team Treehouse trial hoping to find a little more directed learning material to improve my web design skills.

My initial impressions are good though I don't have anything to compare it with. One area I always seemed to have trouble with was understanding CSS layouts which the Treehouse videos cleared right up with me.

Now I know I could definitely find all this information out there in free tutorials but I must admit having it all in one place in well done videos with clearly laid out progression does feel nice.
