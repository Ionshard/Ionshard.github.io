This week was a slower but more theoretical as there was a lot of research into running an internet business. Something that isn't too important now but I don't want to get blindsided by it later. Without further ado, here is the week in review.

### What was done this week?
* Finished 2D Roguelike Tutorial
* Passive Income Research
* Game Grue Designs

### Finished 2D Roguelike Tutorial

I finally finished the 2D Roguelike tutorial for Unity. It wasn't as in depth as I would have liked and defintely didn't seem to follow best practices, or I don't know how to program for Unity. There seems to be a large emphasis on public variables which I normally want to shy away from as inherently bad. 

However it was definitely a good learning experience. I will probably be returning to ETeeski Tutorials for future lessons as they will eventually dive into asset creation which at the moment is what is holding me back from trying to make something for myself.

### Passive Income Research

This week also involved a little bit of a break from the technical side of things and had me diving into the theory behind passive incomes as well as internet marketing. There isn't much to discuss with this topic, just that I will be thinking a little harder about what it is I wish to achieve.

### Game Grue Designs

Stepping up and trying my hand at being creative I decided that since I don't want to shell out $500 for a brand image package from a design company I would have a stab at it myself and I am quite happy with the results. Granted it's incredibly professional feeling but it's pretty good considering my history. So without further ado I give you my logo and my interpretation of a grue!
