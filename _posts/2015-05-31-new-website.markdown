This is the new Ionshard website, I am moving away from a Tumblr hosted blog and moving to a Github hosted Jekyll blog.

This change should allow a little more control over the website as well as allow it to play into the Github culture more.

This is a work in progress and many changes will be occuring as we move towards a better site.
