Missile Defense is my first ever "complete" game, where complete is considered I was happy with the finished product. It is a [Missile Defense][md] clone written in Python using the Pygame library. This was written by me in highschool over the course of a weekend. I barely knew anything that I was doing but I was determined to make an actual game. I had to get a lot of help mostly via IRC and I had to learn a lot of math I hadn't even learned in school yet but it was worth it.

To this day I am still very proud of this game even though it isn't really anything special.
